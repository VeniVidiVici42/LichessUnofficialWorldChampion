# Unofficial World Champion

In many games (especially esports), fans track the "unofficial world championship": one earns the title by defeating the previous owner directly. Of course, the initial unofficial world champion is the first official world champion themselves. For instance, [soccer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unofficial_Football_World_Championships), [League of Legends](https://lol.gamepedia.com/Unofficial_World_Champion), [Starcraft](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Unofficial_World_Champion), etc. religiously track the title's progression.

[Lichess](https://lichess.org) is an internet chess server with arguably one of the largest userbases, and importantly the current world champion [Magnus Carlsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen) regularly plays on this site. Though Lichess was founded in 2010, when [Viswanathan Anand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viswanathan_Anand) was champion, it does not seem Anand publicly plays on Lichess (or any other online site for that matter), making Carlsen the first "unofficial world champion". The [lichess api] makes it possible to track the progression of the title; for instance, the first few title changes are as follows:

```
MeneerMandje defeats DrDrunkenstein on 2018.01.18 21:08:56 (https://lichess.org/mfkhttB0). DrDrunkenstein held the title for 5 games.
toivok defeats MeneerMandje on 2018.01.18 21:09:52 (https://lichess.org/pOKIW7us). MeneerMandje held the title for 1 game.
shrekdavid defeats toivok on 2018.01.18 21:10:48 (https://lichess.org/bYKQs7Rf). toivok held the title for 1 game.
```

As of this time of writing (6/6/2019), the current unofficial world champion is [dozerbull](https://lichess.org/@/dozerbull).
